![Power BI](https://img.shields.io/badge/Power_BI-F2C811?style=for-the-badge&logo=power-bi&logoColor=black)

**Insurance Performance Analysis** is a Power BI dashboard built as part of my **virtual internship** with **AtliQ Technologies** (Data Analyst role).  

The project analyzes insurance data for **Shield Insurance**, a fictional company, to provide insights into claims, premiums, policies, risk profiles, customer segments, and performance metrics. It helps identify trends, high-risk areas, profitable segments, and opportunities for better underwriting and customer retention.

This was a complete end-to-end internship deliverable — from data extraction and SQL querying to dashboard creation and business recommendations.
